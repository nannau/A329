    "\n",
    "## Exploring stellar simulations\n",
    "This platform allows users to explore and analyse different types of simulation data sets. The following areas are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "### [NuGrid](http://www.nugridstars.org) stellar nucleosynthesis data\n",
    "This area is still at the [original NuGrid Wendi](http://wendi.nugridstars.org) and will be moved over to this new platform soon.\n",
    "* [NuGridPy](https://nugrid.github.io/NuGridPy) access to the NuGrid stellar evolution, explosion and nucleosynthesis data\n",
    "* [NuPyCee](http://nugrid.github.io/NuPyCEE)\n",
    "\n",
    "### PPMstar stellar hydro data from [LCSE](http://www.lcse.umn.edu) and [CSA](http://csa.phys.uvic.ca/research/stellar-hydrodynamics)\n",
    "This area has at this point a few test and demo notebooks. It is planned to make more data sets and analysis tools available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [PPMstar area](./PPMstar)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning and teaching\n",
    "The WENDI platform is being used for teaching students the skills of _computational- and data-enabled investigation and analysis_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Teaching\n",
    "\n",
    "* [PHYS248/MATH248 area](./PHYSMATH248)\n",

    "\n",
    "## Technical notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available software\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Terminal\n",
    "build-essential, dvipng, emacs,  git,  gfortran, gcc, latex, less, nano,  python 2.7, pip, rsync, ssh, svn, tqdm,\n",
    "ubuntu, unzip, vim, wget\n",
    "\n",
    "#### jupyter notebooks\n",
    "astropy, keras, matplotlib, mpmath, numpy, python 2 and 3 kernels,  seaborn, setuptools, scikit-learn, scikit-image, scipy, sympy, tensorflow, folium \n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal\n",
    "When using a _Terminal_ (see _New_ dropdown menu on top right) presently the loing shell is `sh`. In order to switch to the much nicer _bash_ shell, just type `bash` at the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is available in the jupyter home section?\n",
    "When you are on the home screen of the jupyter session you will see the content that is located in your home directory's `notebooks` directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform updates\n",
    "When new capabilties or updates are required in the jupyter sessions the platform administrator will build a new jupyter session image. Your currently running instance of the jupyter session image is not effected and will not have these updates until you restart your session. In order to do this proceed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. save your home directory to one of the persistent storage options using the terminal and appropriate terminal commands (e.g. `git`, `rsync` or `ssh`)\n",
    "2. go to the home screen of the jupyter session and click `Logout` in the top right corner\n",
    "3. restart the instance by first clicking on the red `Stop My Server` button to stop the instance; the server needs about 15s to shut down and it is best to wait that moment, and then ...\n",
    "4. on the next screen select the green `My Server` button (you may get an _Error: 500 ..._ just reload the wendi URL and it should work)\n",
    "5. your session should now run the latest docker image\n",
    "6. recover your files in your home directory using the terminal\n",
